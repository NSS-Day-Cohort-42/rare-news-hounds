# Rare: The Puplishing Platform for the Discerning Doggo

This is a learning project. Our goals were to practice full stack development by creating a react client and python-sql back end.

This project was completed in a 6 day Agile-SCRUM sprint. At the start of the project we met with our project manager and assigned point scales to the enhancement tickets based on our estimates of the workload.

As a team, we decided to implement the react-bootstrap styling library on this project. This allowed us to create a consistent appearance across the site.
