# Rare: The Puplishing Platform for the Discerning Doggo

This is a learning project. Our goals were to practice full stack development by creating a react client and python-django back end.

This project was completed in 3 agile-scrum sprints. 
- Week one, wrote the back end in pure python + sql. That repo can be found here: https://github.com/NSS-Day-Cohort-42/rare-server-news-hounds
- Week two, re-wrote the back end using the django framework: 
https://github.com/NSS-Day-Cohort-42/news_hounds_django_server
- Week three, added more functionality to the site (subscriptions & reactions)

As a team, we decided to implement the react-bootstrap styling library on this project. This allowed us to create a consistent appearance across the site.

## Installation Instructions 
Requirements:
NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/)

1. In the terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/NSS-Day-Cohort-42/rare-news-hounds.git`
1. Move into the folder you just created `cd rare-news-hounds`
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start`
1. This will bring up a browser window showing the react app, but you won't be able to log into the site or access data without running the database side of this project. To download and start the server, go to https://github.com/NSS-Day-Cohort-42/news_hounds_django_server, and follow the readme there.
1. Once you are running the sample database, create a new user, and log in to view the site. ðŸ¦® Good Boy!!!ðŸ¦® Give yourself a treat!ðŸ¦®
